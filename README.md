The application is made up of front end and back end:
To run the back end  :
1.	Download wamp server (http://www.wampserver.com/en/ ) or xamp server (https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html). This helps to render the PHP files as well as handle database.
2.	Install the software leaving everything to default (port, password e.t.c)
3.	Take note of the file directory where the software is installed (e.g C:\wamp64 or C:\Xamp).
For Wamp server:
1.	Create a within you root directory (e.g. C:\wamp64\www\custommentor or C:\xamp\htdocs) folder to hold custom mentor files. Copy custom mentor files into the folder.
2.	Double click on the software icon, it should open a notification icon the task bar.
3.	Left click on the icon, and click on local host (or preferably type localhost on your browser)
4.	Next, we need to create a virtual host. To the left of your screen, you should see add virtual host (click it)
5.	Go back to task bar(notification), right click on Wamp server icon, hover on tools, click restart DNS.
6.	To import database files, click on the wampserver icon, click on PHPMYADMIN.
7.	Login to PHP my admin.
8.	Create a database “custom_mentor “.
9.	Click on the newly created Database. On the main horizontal menu, click import database.


For Xamp server:
The process is the same, the only difference is we don’t need to create a virtual host.
