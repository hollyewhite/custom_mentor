        <h3>Why do I need a mentor?</h3>
        <p>CustomMentor maintains that absolutely everyone needs a mentor. If honest, anyone that has achieved success will credit to one extent or another a mentor (or perhaps more than one) in their lives. Regardless of the goal, a mentor can help you get there.</p>
        <p>Whether it is saving for a vacation or retirement, losing weight or getting fit, starting a business or getting a promotion, passing a course or finding your life’s purpose, and anything else, a good mentor is essential. However, the specific personalities and needs of every person vary. You need mentoring tailored to your exact specifications, at a reasonable price, from someone who you can trust who matches your custom designed profile.</p>
