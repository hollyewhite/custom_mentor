        <h3>Why should I be a CustomMentor?</h3>
        <p>Almost everyone can be a mentor. With any background whatsoever, whether a student,
businessperson, doctor, scientist, waiter, checkout clerk, convict, pastor or unemployed person, you
have skills, experience and insight to pass along.
        </p>
        <p>As independent contractors, CustomMentor allows its mentors to choose when and how much to work,
what to charge and who to mentor. Guided by a comprehensive profile CustomMentors are matched
with likely mentees based on your specifications. People will pay for your mentoring services based on
what you bring to the table; your personality, education, intelligence, experience and potential for
contribution.
        </p>
        <p>The benefits for CustomMentors are…</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Flexibility – choose what type of mentoring to provide (cheerleader, mentor, coach, tutor)</li>
