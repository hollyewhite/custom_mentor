              <p className="white">Almost everyone can be a mentor. With any background whatsoever, whether a student,
    businessperson, doctor, scientist, waiter, checkout clerk, convict, pastor or unemployed person, you
    have skills, experience and insight to pass along.</p>
              <p className="white">As independent contractors, CustomMentor allows its mentors to choose when and how much to work,
    what to charge and who to mentor. Guided by a comprehensive profile CustomMentors are matched
    with likely mentees based on your specifications. People will pay for your mentoring services based on
    what you bring to the table; your personality, education, intelligence, experience and potential for
    contribution.</p>
